# Authentication

CALL-E uses project API keys for server-to-server requests.

## API keys

The CALL-E team provisions API keys for approved projects.

You can view your API keys in the [CALL-E dashboard](https://dashboard.heycall-e.com/account/api-keys).

Store the key in your backend secret manager or runtime environment:

```bash
export CALLE_API_KEY="calle_test_key"
```

Do not commit API keys, print them in logs, send them to browser code, or store them in mobile apps. The CALL-E SDKs are server SDKs for trusted backend services and workers.

## Authorization header

Send the API key as a bearer token:

```bash
curl https://api.heycall-e.com/v1/calls \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CALLE_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

SDK clients set this header for you.

TypeScript:

```ts
import { CalleClient } from "@call-e/calle";

const client = new CalleClient({
  apiKey: process.env.CALLE_API_KEY!,
  baseUrl: "https://api.heycall-e.com",
});
```

Python:

```python
import os
from calle import CalleClient

client = CalleClient(
    api_key=os.environ["CALLE_API_KEY"],
    base_url="https://api.heycall-e.com",
)
```

## Environments

Use an explicit base URL in each environment so staging jobs do not accidentally send live calls.

```bash
export CALLE_BASE_URL="https://api.heycall-e.com"
```

The example SDK servers and call scripts read `CALLE_BASE_URL` when you provide it. Keep test and production API keys separate, and do not reuse idempotency keys across environments.

## Server-only usage

Only call the Developer API from trusted server code:

- backend API handlers
- job workers
- workflow runners
- internal automation services

Do not call the Developer API directly from a browser, public frontend, or untrusted client. If a frontend user needs to start a call, send the request to your backend first, validate the user, and let your backend call CALL-E with its project API key.

See [Webhooks](/webhooks) when your backend needs terminal call task
notifications.

## Auth errors

`401 unauthorized` means the API key is missing, malformed, expired, or invalid. Check the `Authorization: Bearer` header and the environment variable loaded by the running process.

`403 forbidden` means the key is valid but does not have access to the requested project, capability, region, or operation.

When rotating keys, deploy the new key to all workers before disabling the old key so in-flight retries do not fail unexpectedly.
