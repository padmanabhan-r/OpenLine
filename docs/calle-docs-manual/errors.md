# Errors

CALL-E returns stable error envelopes for Developer API request failures.

## Error envelope

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The request body is invalid.",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

SDK methods raise typed SDK errors while preserving the stable API error code and response details.

## Stable error codes

- `invalid_request`
- `unauthorized`
- `forbidden`
- `rate_limit_exceeded`
- `insufficient_balance`
- `unsupported_region`
- `unsupported_language`
- `recipient_blocked`
- `policy_violation`
- `call_not_ready`
- `no_recipients`
- `invalid_recipient`
- `invalid_phone`
- `result_schema_invalid`
- `recipient_result_schema_invalid`
- `idempotency_conflict`
- `goal_not_published`
- `goal_not_executable`
- `goal_not_ready`
- `schema_override_not_allowed`
- `variables_invalid`
- `provider_unavailable`
- `internal_error`
- `not_found`

## Recovery guidance

`unauthorized` means the API key is missing or invalid. Check the `Authorization: Bearer` header.

`forbidden` means the key is valid but not allowed to use this resource or capability.

See [Authentication](/authentication) for API key setup, server-only usage, and environment separation.

`rate_limit_exceeded` means the caller should retry after backoff.

`insufficient_balance` means the project cannot start more calls until billing is resolved.

`unsupported_region` or `unsupported_language` means CALL-E could not resolve a supported calling configuration for the request.

`no_recipients` means CALL-E could not infer any recipients from the task and no explicit `recipients` were provided.

`invalid_recipient` means a recipient entry is malformed. Check that each explicit recipient includes a non-empty `phones` array.

`invalid_phone` means a phone number is not valid E.164 format. Replace placeholders such as `<E164_PHONE>` with a phone number you own or are authorized to call.

`result_schema_invalid` means the whole call task `result_schema` is not a valid supported JSON Schema object.

`recipient_result_schema_invalid` means the per-recipient `recipient_result_schema` is not a valid supported JSON Schema object.

`idempotency_conflict` means the same idempotency key was reused with a different request body. Reuse keys only for the same external workflow operation.

`not_found` means a call, Goal, or Goal Run does not exist or is not visible to the current API key. Owner mismatch and hidden Goals use the same code.

`goal_not_published` means an active Goal has no published RunSpec. `goal_not_executable` means the Goal is draft, paused, or retired. Existing Goal Run ids remain readable after a lifecycle change.

`goal_not_ready` means the exact published RunSpec or provider contract does not currently pass the execution gate.

`schema_override_not_allowed` means the Goal Run request attempted to supply a task, RunSpec selector, schema, materialization setting, or provider configuration owned by the published Goal.

`variables_invalid` means the scalar variables do not satisfy the input schema of the RunSpec pinned by the Goal Run.

`call_not_ready` means the call task has not reached a terminal state.

`provider_unavailable` applies only before durable Goal Run acceptance. After acceptance, dispatch, call, or result-processing failures are reported in the existing Goal Run resource's top-level `error` field. Retry transport failures only when the workflow can preserve the same idempotency key and request.

`internal_error` is retryable only when the workflow can safely tolerate retry.
