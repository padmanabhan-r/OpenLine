# SDKs

CALL-E provides server SDKs for trusted backend services, workers, and automation systems that create and monitor call tasks.

## Packages

TypeScript package name:

```text
@call-e/calle
```

Python distribution name:

```text
calle-ai
```

Python imports the package as `calle`:

```python
from calle import CalleClient
```

## Package status

The current stable server SDK packages are:

- TypeScript: `@call-e/calle@0.2.2`
- Python: `calle-ai==0.2.0`

These stable packages support the request-scoped Calls API. The Goal Runs
API and both SDK source candidates are aligned on `0.6.0`; the registry
packages remain Calls-only until that matching SDK release is published.

## Goal Runs preview

The Goal-based SDK surface keeps published contracts separate from the
one-shot Calls API:

- TypeScript: `client.goals.list(...)`, `get(...)`, `run(...)`, `getRun(...)`,
  `waitForResult(...)`, and `runAndWait(...)`
- Python: `client.goals.list(...)`, `get(...)`, `run(...)`, `get_run(...)`,
  `wait_for_result(...)`, and `run_and_wait(...)`

Run requests contain Goal identity, one phone number, per-Run variables, and an
idempotency key. They do not accept request-scoped task text, prompts,
`input_schema`, or `result_schema`; those fields are owned by the published
RunSpec. See the [Goal Runs guide](/goal-runs) for the API contract and SDK
examples.

## Source repositories

The SDKs are maintained as separate repositories so they can have independent release cadence, CI, package metadata, and language-specific examples.

| Runtime | Package | Repository |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript | `@call-e/calle` | [CALLE-AI/server-sdk-typescript](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/server-sdk-typescript) |
| Python | `calle-ai` | [CALLE-AI/server-sdk-python](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/server-sdk-python) |

Each repository includes public source code, examples, and security guidance:

- [TypeScript security policy](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/server-sdk-typescript/blob/main/SECURITY.md)
- [Python security policy](https://github.com/CALLE-AI/server-sdk-python/blob/main/SECURITY.md)

## Local examples

Each SDK repository currently includes runnable examples for the server-side
one-shot call task flow.

TypeScript:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CALLE-AI/server-sdk-typescript.git
cd server-sdk-typescript
pnpm install
pnpm run example:create-and-wait
```

Python:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CALLE-AI/server-sdk-python.git
cd server-sdk-python
uv sync --all-groups
uv run python examples/create_and_wait.py
```

## Stable 0.2 methods

The SDKs expose `context` as a reserved input for future SDK-side workflow data. The current SDKs do not send `context` to the API.

Examples use phone placeholders such as `<E164_PHONE>` and `<RECIPIENT_1_E164_PHONE>`. Replace them with phone numbers you own or are authorized to call.

The SDKs accept structured result schemas as plain JSON objects. Use field `description` values to explain how CALL-E should interpret enum values, and use `type`, `required`, `enum`, and `additionalProperties` for hard validation. See the Calls guide for structured result design patterns and examples.

TypeScript:

```ts
const created = await client.calls.create(
  {
    task: "Call each recipient and ask whether they can attend Friday lunch in San Francisco.",
    recipients: [
      { phones: ["<RECIPIENT_1_E164_PHONE>"] },
      { phones: ["<RECIPIENT_2_E164_PHONE>"] },
    ],
    resultSchema: {
      type: "object",
      required: ["attending_count"],
      properties: {
        attending_count: { type: "integer" },
      },
    },
    recipientResultSchema: {
      type: "object",
      required: ["can_attend"],
      properties: {
        can_attend: { type: "string", enum: ["yes", "no", "unknown"] },
      },
    },
  },
  { idempotencyKey: "wf_123_friday_lunch" },
);

const fetched = await client.calls.get(created.id);
const completed = await client.calls.waitForResult(fetched.id);
const createdAndCompleted = await client.calls.createAndWait(
  {
    task: "Call <E164_PHONE> and confirm their preferred appointment time.",
    resultSchema: {
      type: "object",
      required: ["preferred_time"],
      properties: {
        preferred_time: { type: "string" },
      },
    },
  },
  { timeoutMs: 120_000, intervalMs: 2_000 },
);
const events = await client.calls.listEvents(createdAndCompleted.id, {
  limit: 50,
});
```

Python:

```python
created = client.calls.create(
    task="Call each recipient and ask whether they can attend Friday lunch in San Francisco.",
    recipients=[
        {"phones": ["<RECIPIENT_1_E164_PHONE>"]},
        {"phones": ["<RECIPIENT_2_E164_PHONE>"]},
    ],
    result_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["attending_count"],
        "properties": {"attending_count": {"type": "integer"}},
    },
    recipient_result_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["can_attend"],
        "properties": {
            "can_attend": {"type": "string", "enum": ["yes", "no", "unknown"]},
        },
    },
    idempotency_key="wf_123_friday_lunch",
)

fetched = client.calls.get(created["id"])
completed = client.calls.wait_for_result(fetched["id"])
created_and_completed = client.calls.create_and_wait(
    task="Call <E164_PHONE> and confirm their preferred appointment time.",
    result_schema={
        "type": "object",
        "required": ["preferred_time"],
        "properties": {"preferred_time": {"type": "string"}},
    },
    timeout_seconds=120,
    interval_seconds=2,
)
events = client.calls.list_events(created_and_completed["id"], limit=50)
```

## Availability
