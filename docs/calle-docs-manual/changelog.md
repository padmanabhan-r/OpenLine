# What's New

Product updates for the CALL-E Developer API and server SDKs.

## July 29, 2026

### Terminal webhook delivery

Call tasks that include `webhook_url` now send terminal event notifications to
that URL. Each notification includes a stable event id for idempotent
processing, and delivery is retried when the receiver does not return a `2xx`
response. CALL-E waits until the post-call outcome and requested structured
results are finalized, so the webhook contains the same complete terminal
snapshot returned by the Calls API.

Current deliveries include `CALL-E-Event-Id` for deduplication and do not
include a webhook secret, timestamp, or signature header. Receivers must treat
the payload as untrusted input, validate the event shape, and compare the
header event id with the body `id`. The Python and TypeScript SDKs keep their
legacy signed-webhook helpers only for source compatibility and mark them
deprecated.

### Phone-only Goal Run requests in API 0.6

Create Goal Run requests now use a top-level `phone` plus `variables`. The `target` wrapper and per-Run `region`, `locale`, and `display_name` fields have been removed. Voice region and callee locale are fixed by the published Goal; recipient names needed by the conversation belong in the Goal's input schema and are supplied through `variables`.

The TypeScript and Python SDK source candidates now implement the matching
`client.goals` surface at version `0.6.0`, including Goal discovery, Run
creation, Run reads, and result-or-error polling. Existing Calls and Webhooks
surfaces remain compatible; registry packages stay on their current stable
versions until the 0.6.0 release is published.

### Simplified Goal Runs API 0.5

1. Useful Goal metadata: Goal list and get responses now include the current published `title` and `description` alongside the input and result schemas.

2. Smaller response: Goal and Goal Run responses expose RunSpec ids and versions without content fingerprints.

3. One result contract: a Goal Run returns the parsed object directly in `result`, or one unified `error` when execution or result processing fails. When both are null, clients continue polling.

4. Goal discovery: `GET /v1/goals` lists the authenticated owner's active, listed, published Goal interfaces with opaque cursor pagination. The API 0.5 SDK design adds `client.goals.list(...)` in both TypeScript and Python while keeping stable 0.2 packages Calls-only until a matching SDK minor is released.

### Goal Runs API preview

1. Published Goal interface: Read the current normalized input schema, result schema, and RunSpec identity with `GET /v1/goals/{goal_id}`.

2. Goal Run creation: Create one singleton Run with `POST /v1/goals/{goal_id}/runs`. Requests supply one target, scalar variables, and a required business-stable `Idempotency-Key`; they cannot replace the published schemas or choose a RunSpec version. Initial acceptance and exact replay both return `201`.

3. Result polling: Read execution and schema-bound results with `GET /v1/goals/{goal_id}/runs/{goal_run_id}`. The Goal Run preserves the exact RunSpec version pinned when CALL-E accepted it.

4. SDK transition: The Goal Runs guide defines TypeScript and Python parity on `client.goals`, with `get`, `run`, get-Run, wait, and run-and-wait helpers using each language's naming convention. Stable 0.2 SDK packages continue to support the one-shot Calls API until matching next-minor packages are released.

See [Goal Runs](/goal-runs) for request, polling, version-pinning, and SDK examples.

### What's New: Developer API and server SDKs

1. Developer API: Create outbound call tasks, retrieve call task details, list call task events, and receive terminal webhook messages from a trusted server environment.

2. TypeScript server SDK: The CALL-E TypeScript server SDK is available on npm.

```bash
pnpm add @call-e/calle
```

Use `CalleClient` to create a call task and wait for a terminal result.

3. Python server SDK: The CALL-E Python server SDK is available on PyPI.

```bash
pip install calle-ai
```

Import `CalleClient` from `calle` to create call tasks and poll results.

4. Server-side integrations: API keys and server SDKs are designed for trusted backend services, workers, and automation systems. Browser SDKs, scheduled call tasks, cancel call task APIs, and project-level webhook management are not part of this release.
