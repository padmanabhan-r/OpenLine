# Webhooks

Use webhooks when your application needs to react to terminal call task results without polling.

Phone values in examples are placeholders. Real webhook payloads echo the phone numbers from your call task.

CALL-E publishes a terminal event only after the post-call summary, task
completion judgment, confidence, evidence, and any requested structured results
are finalized. The event `data` is the same complete terminal snapshot returned
by `GET /v1/calls/{call_id}`.

## Terminal events

CALL-E sends terminal webhook events:

- `call.completed`
- `call.failed`
- `call.result_validation_failed`

`call.result_validation_failed` is sent when a completed call task had an internal structured-result validation failure for the task or a recipient. The payload does not expose validation details; invalid or unsupported structured results are returned as `null`. Failed or canceled terminal call tasks use `call.failed`.

Each event has an `id`, `type`, `created_at`, and a `data` object containing the complete terminal call task fields.

Recipient-level structured results appear inside the `recipients` array. They do not create separate recipient webhook events.

Attempt transcripts appear as `recipients[].attempts[].transcript_turns`. Each turn includes `offset_seconds`, `speaker`, and `text`; the array is empty when no transcript is available.

Example payload:

## Receive events

Current CALL-E webhook delivery does not use a webhook secret,
`CALL-E-Timestamp`, or `CALL-E-Signature`. Treat the receiver as a public,
untrusted-input boundary: validate the JSON shape, require
`CALL-E-Event-Id`, and reject the request when that header does not match the
body event `id`.

TypeScript:

```ts
const event = JSON.parse(rawBody.toString("utf8"));
const eventId = request.headers.get("CALL-E-Event-Id");

if (!eventId || eventId !== event.id) {
  return new Response("invalid event id", { status: 400 });
}

if (event.type === "call.completed") {
  console.log(event.data.id, event.data.recipients);
}
```

Python:

```python
event = json.loads(raw_body)
event_id = request.headers.get("CALL-E-Event-Id")

if not event_id or event_id != event["id"]:
    return {"error": "invalid_event_id"}, 400

if event["type"] == "call.completed":
    print(event["data"]["id"], event["data"]["recipients"])
```

Return a `2xx` response after accepting the event. CALL-E retries delivery when
the receiver returns a non-`2xx` response or the request fails.

HTTPS and event-id matching do not provide cryptographic proof of the sender.
Before a sensitive side effect that requires origin assurance, fetch
`GET /v1/calls/{call_id}` with your API key and compare its terminal snapshot
with the event.

## Idempotent handling

Webhook delivery is at least once. Store the webhook event `id` before processing side effects so duplicate deliveries are ignored safely.

TypeScript:

```ts
if (await eventStore.has(event.id)) {
  return new Response("duplicate", { status: 200 });
}

await eventStore.insert(event.id);
await handleCallEvent(event);
```

Python:

```python
if event_store.has(event["id"]):
    return {"ok": True, "duplicate": True}

event_store.insert(event["id"])
handle_call_event(event)
```
